# Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! Below, you'll find detailed information on some of the key projects I've worked on. Each project includes a description, technologies used, models implemented, and links to the source code.

## Project 1: Automatic Ticket Classification

**Problem Statement:**  
The goal of this project is to automate the classification of customer complaints using unstructured text data from customer support tickets. The company offers products such as credit cards, banking, and mortgages. This data is categorized using topic modeling and then fed into supervised models to classify future complaints. This improves response times and customer satisfaction.

**Technologies Used:**  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, sklearn, XGBoost

**Models:**  
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, XGBoost Classifier

## Project 2: Melanoma Cancer Detection

**Problem Statement:**  
This project involves building a custom CNN model using TensorFlow to detect melanoma from skin images. Given melanoma accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths, the goal is to support early detection and improve patient outcomes.

**Technologies Used:**  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras

**Models:**  
CNN Sequential Model, Augmentation using Augmentor

## Project 3: Gesture Recognition for Smart TVs

**Problem Statement:**  
The project aims to enable gesture recognition for smart TVs, allowing users to control the TV without a remote by recognizing five specific hand gestures. Each gesture corresponds to an action like increasing/decreasing volume or pausing playback.

**Technologies Used:**  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Keras, Imageio

**Models:**  
Conv3D, CNN-LSTM, Transfer Learning

## Project 4: HelpMate AI (Generative AI)

**Problem Statement:**  
The project involves developing a semantic search system using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for document retrieval. It leverages vector embeddings with SentenceTransformerEmbedding and a caching layer to efficiently answer user queries.

**Technologies Used:**  
pdfplumber, chromaDB, Pandas, OpenAI, pathlib

**Steps:**  
PDF Chunking, Embedding Generation using OpenAI, Semantic Search, Caching Layer, RAG

## Project 5: Telecom Churn Case Study

**Problem Statement:**  
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn for a telecom company. Using customer-level data from three months, the model aims to identify customers at high risk of churn in the final month and enable the company to take actions to retain them.

**Technologies Used:**  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost, sklearn, lightgbm, seaborn, matplotlib

**Models:**  
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM

## Project 6: Lending Club Case Study

**Problem Statement:**  
This project focuses on identifying patterns that indicate if a person is likely to default on a loan. The insights gained help inform decisions about whether to lend, adjust loan terms, or deny the loan entirely to mitigate risk.

**Technologies Used:**  
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
